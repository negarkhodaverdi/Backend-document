Create Virtual Environment:
    python -m venv .venv

Now You Need To Install Django:
    python -m pip install django

Now, You Need To Create Your Project Like:
    django-admin startproject [your-project-name]

But There Is Some Better Way That I Personally Always Use. You Have To Create A Folder With Name Of Your Project.
After That Go Inside The Folder That You Made. After That Open CMD Or Terminal That You User There. After That
Type This Command :
    django-admin startproject settings .

It Will Help You In The Future That You Can Separate Your Main Project Folder With Apps That Are In Your Project.
